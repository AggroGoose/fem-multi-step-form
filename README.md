# Project Overview

This project is a challenge project offered by Front End Mentor. Front End Mentor provides the design assets and explains intended functionality, but the frameworks and path to creating the project is left to the user.

I chose this project as I had not worked with multi-step forms yet and wanted to experiment with Svelte 5s rune system as I hadn't worked with Svelte Stores since Svelte 4.

Ultimately I found that, in contradiction to my state management experiences in React, Svelte 5s rune system is incredibly intuitive. Everything I tried, "just to see if it will work", worked out just as intended with little to no extra troubleguessing needed. While this was a relatively small project, it was enjoyable during its duration.
